            <h2 class="instructions">Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 tsp of salt.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skilled over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil
                in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken to plate and set aside.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium and add onion, garlic and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet.
                Cook and stir until onion turns soft and trasnlucent (5-8 mins). Stir curry powder, cumin,
                tumeric, coriander, cayenne and about 1 Tbsp of water into the onion mixture and allow it to
                heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.</li>
                <li>Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 Tbsp of chopped cilantro and 1 tsp of salt to the mixture; stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Return chicken to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup of water
                and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1
                Tbsp of cilantro over the chicken.</li>
                <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chick breasts are no longer pink in the center and the
                juices run clear (about 20 mins). An instant-read thermometer in chicken should read at least 165F
                Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
