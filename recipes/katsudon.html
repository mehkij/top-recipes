        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In Japanese, "Katsu" means "cutlet", and "don" means "bowl". There are many different kinds of
        "don" recipes, with beef, bowl, chicken, etc.</p>
        <p>Katsudon is a fried pork cutlet breaded with panko over rice with an egg crowning the bowl.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 center-cut boneless pork chops (pounded down to a centimeter thick)</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>flour (for dusting)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup of panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of dashi stock or chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 tsp of sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp of soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp of mirin</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized onion (thinly sliced)</li>
            <li>2 servings of steamed white rice</li>
            <li>1 scallion (chopped)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper, and dust with a light, even coating of
            flour. In a shallow bowl, beat the egg. Put the panko breadcrumbs into another shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Add a thin, even layer of oil to a cast iron pan or skillet over medium heat. You'll know
            the oil is ready when you throw a breadcrumb into it and it sizzles. Dip the pork into the egg
            to coat. Transfer the pork into the panko and press it evenly to get a good coating.</li>
            <li>Carefully lay the pork chops into the hot oil and cook for 5-6 minutes on one side until
            golden brown. Flip and cook the other side for another 5-6 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with
            paper towel.</li>
            <li>While the pork is resting, add the stock, sugar, soy sauce, and mirin to a small bowl.
            In another bowl, lightly beat 2 eggs. Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan over medium heat, and
            add the sliced onion. Fry them until they're translucent and slightly caramelized.</li>
            <li>Pour the stock mixture over the onions. Slice your tonkatsu into strips and place them
            on top of the onions. Drizzle the egg over everything. Cook over medium low heat until the egg
            is just set. Serve over bowls of steamed rice, and garnish with scallions.</li>
        </ol>
