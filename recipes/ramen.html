            <h2 class="instructions">Instructions</h2>

            <h3>Chashu Pork Belly</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine your soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a ziploc bag large enough to 
                hold the pork belly. Place a straw in the bag and seal the bag up against it (so the straw is the
                only opening). Suck as much air as you can out of the bag and then seal it.</li>
                <li>Sous vide the pork for 10-11 hours at 170F.</li>
                <li>Remove the pork from the ziploc bag. Discard bag and marinade.</li>
                <li>Let the pork belly cool completely.</li>
                <li>Slice across the chashu pork (so you get bacon-like slices) into 8-12 slices about 1/8 to
                3/16 inches thick. Reserve the leftovers, as you won't need all the pork for 4 servings.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Soy Bacon Tare</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all of the ingredients into a small sauce pan. Simmer at the lowest setting for
                about an hour. Top up with a bit of chicken stock if needed.</li>
                <li>Remove the bacon.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Miso Tare</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all of the ingredients into a small sauce pan and simmer at the lowest setting for
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Medium Boiled Eggs</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring enough water to cover the eggs to a boil. If you have a way to prick the eggshell,
                do it. Boil large eggs for 6 mins 30 secs. If using extra large eggs, add a minute. You may
                have to adjust times slightly depending on the exact size of your egg.</li>
                <li>Submerge the eggs in ice water to chill. This stops the egg yolks from continuing to set.
                Peel your eggs, and cut in half right before you serve your ramen.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Assemble Your Ramen</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the ramen noodles in plenty of water as directed by the packaging. If there's no 
                translation on the packaging, it's usually 4 minutes. You don't need to salt the water.</li>
                <li>Cook the mushrooms alongside the noddles (you just want them softened).</li>
                <li>Gently fry the chashu pork in a non-stick skillet until lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Place 1/4 of whichever tare you are using in the bottom of four bowls.</li>
                <li>Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the tonkotsu broth into each of the bowls, and stir to mix.</li>
                <li>Add the noodles, then pour in another 1 1/2 cups of the broth per bowl.</li>
                <li>Place the eggs, mushrooms, pork and green onions into each bowl.</li>
            </ol>
